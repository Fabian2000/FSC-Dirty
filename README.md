# FSC-Dirty
A userfriendly crossplatform scripting language built in C#

## Why FSC-Dirty?
FSC-Dirty is a dirty language. It is terrible to use

## Goal of FSC-Dirty
The goal of FSC-Dirty is to be a programming language, that a computer can work with really quick. It is made, that you are able to build your own programming language, without caring about how to make it run.
You only need to compile your programming / scripting language to FSC-Dirty and use the runtime to make it work.
That's it. A pretty project for people that want their own language

## Can it run by itself, without building an own language on top of it?
Sure it can! It is still a programming language. Simple, but fast and made for computers, not for people.

> Don't be scared of building your own programming / scripting language. Make it easy. Use FSC-Dirty
