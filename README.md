# FSC-Dirty
A userfriendly crossplatform scripting language built in C#

## Why FSC-Dirty?
FSC-Dirty is a dirty language. It is terrible to use.

## Why is FSC-Beauty better?
FSC-Beauty is a layer on top of FSC-Dirty and the compiler compiles to FSC-Dirty. If your plan is to write a script and not make your own language, you should use FSC-Beauty instead of FSC-Dirty. If your plan is to make your own programming language without caring about a runtime, FSC-Dirty is the go!

## Goal of FSC-Dirty
The goal of FSC-Dirty is to be a programming language, that a computer can work with really quick. It was made, so that you are able to build your own programming language, without caring about how to make it run.
You only need to compile your programming / scripting language to FSC-Dirty and use the runtime to make it work.
That's it. A pretty project for people that want their own language

## Goal of FSC-Dirty
A modern, but easy to use programming language to write small scripts or create plugins for your own software.

## Can it run by itself, without building an own language on top of it?
Sure it can! It is still a programming language. Simple, but fast and made for computers, not for people.

> Don't be scared of building your own programming / scripting language. Make it easy. Use FSC-Dirty
